# Welcome :alembic:!

Here is Tommaso, a Mechanical Engineer with a strong passion for Computer Science.

This is the place where I host all my repos related to my personal website and all the microservices I have developed over the years.
Everything started as a simple and harmless blog site and has grown into a full-fledged platform with many features and services.

I hope you enjoy your stay here and find something useful for your projects.

As always, feel free to contact me if you have any questions or want to collaborate on something.

Cheers! :beers:
